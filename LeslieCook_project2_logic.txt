% This program creates a Family tree using Prolog logic facts and rules.
% We create a set facts of males of females with names of family members
% We create a set of rules that define who everyone's parents are
% Using the the facts (male/female) and rules (parents), we create rules to define the relationships
% of children, grandparents, brothers, sisters, and come up with at least 2 more relationship rules
% side note: the "once" function makes sure that Term runs only one time, when a parent is initialized more than once
